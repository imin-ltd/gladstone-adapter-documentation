# Gladstone Adapter
The OpenActive Gladstone Adapter has been built by imin as an interim solution to implement the OpenActive standards within the Gladstone software.

## Limitations

- This adapter will only work for a small number of sites (< 10), and requires site data to be manually updated.

## Example

- A complete example including all properties available can be found here: https://imin-ltd.github.io/gladstone-adapter-documentation/example.json

## Standards
- The data feed produced by the adapter is published to conform to [OpenActive Realtime Paged Data Exchange 0.2.3](https://www.openactive.io/realtime-paged-data-exchange/0.2.3/) and [OpenActive Modelling Opportunity Data](https://www.openactive.io/modelling-opportunity-data/), using features from the [OpenActive Beta Namespace](https://www.openactive.io/ns-beta/).
